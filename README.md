# Cisco_Prime_Infrastructure
Repository for Prime Infrastructure config templates and Compliance Policies

Hi.  My name is Lewis Hickman and I work for Cisco as a Customer Solutions Architect specializing in network managment and Prime Infrastructure.  I created this repository as a way for folks to share any configuration templates or compliance policies that other may find useful.  I have had to create a number of both configuration templates as well as compliance policies to achieve a number different outcomes in prime infrastructure.  As such, I wanted to make these available to any and all that may find them useful or simple want examples to help create your own.

Please feel free to post your own creations in the repository.  My goal is to try and have a single git hub location for all Prime Infrastructure config templates and compliance policies for the public to use.
